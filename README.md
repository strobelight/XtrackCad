# XtrackCad

[XTrackCAD](https://xtrkcad-fork.sourceforge.net/Wikka/HomePage) is a CAD program for designing model railroad layouts.

This repo is simply what I did to get it to compile on debian systems, specifically raspberry pi, and android (a pixel phone). Compilation on android made use of [UserLAnd App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula&gl=US) which must be installed first, and configured to use debian distribution with lxde.
